# Last One Loses

Requirements:
- Python 3
- Tkinter

Run:
`python last-one-loses.py`

Instructions:

Play a board game against the computer or another opponent. Each player takes a turn and removes 1, 2 or 3 tiles from the board (selecting them by clicking on them - clicking on one again will deselect it). The player who is forced to take the last tile off the board loses the game.

Note: when the computer starts the play it will always win (see the algorithm in the source code).
