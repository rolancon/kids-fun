# Pig Latin

This is a simple English to [Pig Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin) transcriber written in [UCBLogo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCBLogo).

It can transcribe both single words and lists of words (sentences). It is based on the [Wikipedia example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCBLogo#Transcribe_a_sentence_into_Pig_latin_example). The comments in the source code are in Dutch because I used it as an example for my kids.

An example to transcribe a single word:
`print pl "blue` --> `ueblay`

An example to transcribe a sentence:
`print pl [pig latin is fun]` --> `igpay atinlay isay unfay`
