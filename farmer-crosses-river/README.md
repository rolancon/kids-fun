# Farmer Crosses River

The object of this game is for the farmer to safely bring his possessions, a wolf, a goat and a cabbage, across the river using his boat, from the south shore to the north shore.

Only one other possession fits in his boat with him at the same time. However, be aware that if the farmer takes his boat to the other shore and leaves the goat and the cabbage behind unguarded, the goat will eat the cabbage. And if he leaves the wolf and the goat behind unguarded, the wolf will eat the goat. Then you will have lost the game.
